# Changelog

All notable changes to `bankstatementparser-loader-camt054` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `get_summary()` returns `Camt054SummaryRecord`, a `SummaryRecord` subtype carrying the
  same keys as before (message and account ids, currency, creation date, notification and entry counts, and credit and debit totals), so the override matches the core parser's
  `SummaryRecord` contract and `mypy` passes against bankstatementparser 0.0.29.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Initial production release of `bankstatementparser-loader-camt054`: ISO 20022 CAMT.054 Real-Time Notification Loader.
- 100% statement and branch test coverage.
- High-concurrency throughput testing (>10,000 TPS) with sub-second response times.
- Strict type hints (`mypy --strict`) and ruff linting.
- Integration with the core `bankstatementparser` ecosystem.
